# Investigating-motivations-and-feedback-on-social-media-on-psychological-well-being

This research paper aims to investigate the influence of an individual's motivations for using social media and the feedback received on their psychological wellbeing. Social networking sites (SNSs) have revolutionized the way people connect with each other and provide numerous benefits such as increasing social capital. However, research shows that SNS usage can also lead to negative moods and body image concerns due to appearance-based social comparisons. This study will use network analysis to explore how an individual's personal motivations for using social media and the feedback received on these platforms affect their psychological wellbeing. Previous studies have indicated various motivations underlying Facebook usage, but this research will focus on Instagram, which has received less attention in the literature. The results of this study will help to better understand the impact of social media on mental health and provide insights for the development of interventions to improve psychological wellbeing.
